- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    Using class components allows you to hold state or data. Functional components are able to be used if there is no state or data to hold.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    componentDidMount = starts at the beginning of the lifecycle or Mounting phase. The initial data you want to access will be defined.

    componentDidUpdate = starts when a variable changes or there is an update to component data.

    componentWillUnmount = starts at the end of the lifecycle to remove the component from the screen and do any clean up that may need to be done.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    A custom hook allows us to have a reusable piece of stateful code that will not affect data or make unwanted changes to data.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    So that we can minimize bugs and encourage us to write better and more testable code.
